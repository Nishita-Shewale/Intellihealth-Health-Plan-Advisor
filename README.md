# üß† Intelligent Health Plan Advisor (IntelliHealth)

**Last Updated**: April 2025

## üìù Project Overview

**IntelliHealth** is an intelligent backend system designed to recommend U.S. health insurance plans based on patient demographics, healthcare needs, and financial constraints. The system integrates three powerful data layers ‚Äî **PostgreSQL**, **Snowflake**, and **Neo4j** ‚Äî along with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to make advanced, explainable plan recommendations.

## üéØ Key Features

### üîê Patient Profile Management
- Create, retrieve, and manage patient data (stored in **PostgreSQL**)
- Demographics include medical history, lifestyle, occupation, budget, family status

### üìä Insurance Plan Retrieval & Filtering
- Query large-scale plan data from **Snowflake**
- Apply initial filtering based on patient state, budget tier, medical needs, and travel preferences
- Data normalization ensures compatibility with internal models

### ‚öñÔ∏è Rule-Based Plan Scoring (Neo4j)
- Apply **customized rules** to further filter plans dynamically based on:
  - Chronic conditions (e.g. **Diabetes Rule**)
  - Age group (**Older Adults Rule**)
  - Gender and age (**Maternity Rule**)
  - Family needs (**Family Coverage Rule**)
- Rule logic uses **per-plan-type median thresholds** for fairness

### ü§ñ LLM-Based Dynamic Scoring
- Plans passing Neo4j rules are ranked using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting
- LLMs evaluate each plan attribute‚Äôs relevance to the patient context
- Scoring is **dynamic**, **explainable**, and personalized


### üîÑ Multi-Model LLM Support
- Supports both **Snowflake Cortex (Claude)** and **OpenAI models (GPT-4o, o3)**
- Flexible backend toggle allows switching models at runtime
- Normalized output structure ensures consistent frontend rendering

### üìà Plan Distribution & Rule Metrics
- Visual breakdown of how many rules each plan satisfies
- PlanType summaries (e.g., HMO vs PPO match count) assist downstream decisions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-org>/intellihealth.git
   cd intellihealth

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   Copy .env.example to .env and populate with credentials:
   
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/intellihealth_db
   SNOWFLAKE_USER=<your-user>
   SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=<your-account>
   SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=HEALTHCARE
   SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=HEALTHCARE_INSURANCE_DB
   SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=PLAN_SCHEMA
   SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=<your-role>
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://neo4j:7687
   NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/neo4jpassword


## üì¨ API Highlights

- `POST /patients/` ‚Üí Add patient
- `GET /insurance-plans/` ‚Üí View all plans
- `POST /filter-plans/` ‚Üí SQL-level filtering via Snowflake
- `POST /process-plans/` ‚Üí Apply Neo4j rules and match plans
- `GET /plan-distribution/` ‚Üí See how many rules each plan satisfies
- `POST /recommend-insurance/` ‚Üí LLM-based scoring (select model dynamically)

## üß† What Makes It Smart?

- Uses **summary statistics** to dynamically adjust rule thresholds  
  _(e.g., medians for different PlanTypes)_
- Leverages **LLMs** to mimic expert reasoning for plan recommendation
- Capable of adapting to **multiple models** and **changing attributes** without rewriting code

 Time to configure the magic behind the scenes! We‚Äôve provided a handy .env.example file as a template. Duplicate it to .env, then fill in your database and service credentials. 
 Think of this as giving IntelliHealth the keys to connect to PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Neo4j. Replace placeholders like <your-user> with your actual Snowflake details‚Äîdon‚Äôt 
 worry, we won‚Äôt peek!
